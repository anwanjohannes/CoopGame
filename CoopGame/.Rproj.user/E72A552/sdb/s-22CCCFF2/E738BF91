Since the initial program for minimizing the maximum propensity to disruption is non-linear, the equivalent linear program is used for determination and the method **determineExcessCoefficients** is overwritten. The assignment of the coefficients for the structure variable to be minimized here corresponds to the expression [V (N) -V (S) -V (N-S)] from the first condition of formula.\nSince the decision variable t to be minimized from the equivalent linear program is additionally limited to the range -1 <t <0, the method **initLPBndsObjCoefs** must also be overwritten. \n",
