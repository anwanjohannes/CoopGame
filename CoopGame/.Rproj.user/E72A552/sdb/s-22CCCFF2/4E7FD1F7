As **SetSolutionConcept** it contains the wrapper method **calculateSolution** and the method **calculatePointSolution**.\nBecause some point valued concepts can be also applied as power index concepts and vice versa, additionaly **calculatePowerIndex** is defined.\nThe implementation of **calculatePowerIndex** within the class **PointSolutionConcept** calls **calculatePointSolution** to determine the power index as the ratio of each player's share towards the gain of the grand coalition.\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\nsetMethod(\n  \"calculatePowerIndex\",\n  signature=\"PointSolutionConcept\",\n  definition=function(.Object){\n    pointSolution=calculatePointSolution(.Object)\n    sum=sum(pointSolution)\n    return(pointSolution/sum)\n  }\n)\n```\nWhereas the implementation of **calculatePointSolution** uses **calculatePowerIndex** by distributing the gain of the grand coalitions according the share derived from their personal power index.\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\nsetMethod(\n  \"calculatePointSolution\",\n  signature=\"PointSolutionConcept\",\n  definition=function(.Object){\n    A<-.Object@A\n    N<-length(A)\n    powerIndex<-calculatePowerIndex(.Object)\n    return((powerIndex*A[N])/sum(powerIndex))\n  }\n)\n```\nIn case the concept to implemented belongs to the group of power indices it is sufficient to reimplement the **calculatePowerIndex**, when it is a point solution concept to reimplement **calculatePointSolution**. By doing like this at the same time for both point solution and power index concepts methods for identifying the point solution as well as determining the power index are realized.  \nFor the simple user again wrapper functions are provided, which are named by following patterns:\nFor visualization of point solution the function **draw<conceptname>Value**, retrieving the power index **<conceptname>Index** and getting the point value **<conceptname>Value**.",
