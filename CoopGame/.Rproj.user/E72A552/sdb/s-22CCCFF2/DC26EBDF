In designing a framework for the calculation of the nucleolus and its derivatives, other key considerations besides a desired clean separation of responsibilities came into play.\nOn the one hand, it was important to be able to react as flexibly as possible to the differences between the various derivatives; on the other hand, redundant code should be avoided as much as possible.\nTherefore it is able to deal with possible differences between the various variants in the individual calculation steps and helps to avoid redundant code.\nFor a first separation of responsibilities, two classes were implemented: the class `LPCoopGameUtils` and `NucleolusBase`.\nThe intention of the `LPCoopGameUtils` class was to delineate tasks and data held in the context of the Linear Program from the logic for calculating the nucleolus or one of its derivatives. However, the class `NucleolusBase` has the responsibility for the implementation of the calculation algorithm.\n![Class Diagramme of the Nucleolus Framework](media/class_diagramme_nucleolus_framework.PNG)\nThe two classes will be discussed in the following sections. However, a brief introduction to the GLPK Library used for the linear program solution is given in advance. \n",
