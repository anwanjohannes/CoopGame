An incumbent \nstrategy $x$ is said to be evolutionary stable if \n\n- it is either a unique best reply to itself or   \n- in case there exists an alternative best reply $y$ to $x$,\nthen $x$ is a better reply to this mutant strategy $y$ than \n$y$ is to itself.  \n\nIf $x$ is a strict Nash equilibrium, then $x$ must also be an ESS.  \nUsing our package EvolutionaryGames one can compute ESS \nfor both $2$ x $2$ and $3$ x $3$ symmetric matrix games.\nThe function **ESS.R** receives three input arguments:\n\n- `A` : A matrix specifying the symmetric game\n- `strategies`: A vector of strings of length $2$ or $3$ \nspecifying the names of all strategies\n- `floats`: A logical value that handles number representation. If floats \nis set to `TRUE` (default), a floating-point number will be used for the \noutput, otherwise the output will be \nspecified as fractions.\n\nLet us first take a look at a classical Hawk-Dove game.\n\n```{r, fig.show='hold'}\nlibrary(CoopGame)\n```\n\nIt is well known that there are games which do not possess \nan ESS. A classical example is the game Rock-Scissors-Paper.\nIn such a case our function **ESS.R** will return NULL.\n\n```{r, fig.show='hold'}\nlibrary(CoopGame)\n```",
