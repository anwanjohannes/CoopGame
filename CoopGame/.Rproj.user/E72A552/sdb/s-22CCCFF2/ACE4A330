This game property can be checked via the \nfunction **isNonnegativeGame**. We only provide certain solution concepts \nfor nonnegative games.\n\n### Essential games\n\nWe call a TU game $v$ **essential**, if the value of the \ngrand coalition $v(N)$ is greater than the \nsum of the values of the singleton \ncoalitions $v(\\{i\\})$, i.e.\n\n$$v(N) > \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v(\\{i\\}).$$\n\nOur definition follows the book by Chakravarty,\nMitra and Sarkar [@ChakravartyMitraSarkar], p. 23.\nWe find it very convenient that according to this definition \nthe imputation set of an essential game is nonempty and consists \nof more than one point.\nThis game property can be checked via the \nfunction **isEssentialGame**.\n\n### Degenerate games\n\nWe call a TU game $v$ **degenerate** (or **inessential**), if \nthe value of the \ngrand coalition $v(N)$ equals the \nsum of the values of the singleton \ncoalitions $v(\\{i\\})$, i.e.\n\n$$v(N) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} v(\\{i\\}).$$\nWe find it very convenient that according to this definition \nthe imputation set of a degenerate game consists\nof exactly one point (specified by the singleton coalitions).\nThis game property can be checked via the \nfunction **isDegenerateGame**.\n\n### Monotonic games\n\nAccording to the book by \nPeleg and Sudhölter [@PelegSudhoelter], p. 12, \nwe call a TU game $v$ **monotonic** if \n\n$$ S \\subseteq T \\subseteq N \\Rightarrow v(S) \\leq v(T). $$\nThis game property can be checked via the \nfunction **isMonotonicGame**.\n\n### Simple games\n\nAlong the lines of the book by \nPeleg and Sudhölter [@PelegSudhoelter], p. 16 f., \nwe call a TU game $v$ **simple** if \n$v$ is monotonic and the values of all coalitions are \n$0$ or $1$. This game property can be checked via the \nfunction **isSimpleGame**.\n\n### Symmetric games\n\nFollowing the book by \nPeleg and Sudhölter [@PelegSudhoelter], p. 12, \nwe call a TU game $v$ **symmetric** if\nthe values of all \ncoalitions containing the same number of players are identical, i.e.\n\n$$ \\vert S \\vert = \\vert T \\vert \\Rightarrow v(S) = v(T) $$\nfor all coalitions $S,T \\subseteq N$. \nThis game property can be checked via the \nfunction **isSymmetricGame**.\n\n### Constant-sum games \n\nIn a **constant-sum** game $v$ for any coalition $S$ the sums\nof $v(S)$ and its complement $v(N \\backslash S)$ equal\n$v(N)$, i.e. \n$$ v(S) + v(N \\backslash S) = v(N) $$\nfor all $S \\subseteq N$, see e.g. [@PelegSudhoelter], p. 11 or\n[@OsborneRubinsteinBook], p. 261.\nThis game property can be checked via the \nfunction **isConstantSumGame**.\n\n### Weakly constant-sum games\nWe call a TU game $v$ with $n$ players\n**weakly constant-sum** as long as\nthe constant-sum condition holds for coalitions of\nsizes $1$ and $n-1$, i.e.\n$$ v(\\{i\\}) + v(N \\backslash \\{i\\}) = v(N) $$\nfor all players $i=1, \\dots, n$. In other words:\nFor weakly constant-sum games the vector of singleton\ncoalitions and the utopia payoff vector coincide.\nThis game property comes in handy when checking\nuniqueness conditions for the Gately point, see\nthe paper [@StaudacherAnwander]. Also note that\nany constant-sum game is weakly constant-sum, but not\nvice versa.\nThis game property can be checked via the \nfunction **isWeaklyConstantSumGame**.\n\n\n### Superadditive games\n\nWe call a TU game $v$ **superadditive** if \n\n$$ v(S \\cup T) \\geq v(S) + v(T) $$\nfor all coalitions $S, T \\subseteq N$ with $S \\cap T = \\emptyset$,\nsee e.g. [@PelegSudhoelter], p. 10, or [@MaschlerSolanZamir], p. 671.\nThe idea of superadditivity is that disjoint groups of players\nare never punished for cooperating.\nThis game property can be checked via the \nfunction **isSuperadditiveGame**.\n\n\n### Additive games\n\nWe call a TU game $v$ **additive** if \n\n$$ v(S \\cup T) = v(S) + v(T) $$\nfor all coalitions $S, T \\subseteq N$ with $S \\cap T = \\emptyset$,\nsee e.g. [@PelegSudhoelter], p. 11, or [@MaschlerSolanZamir], p. 792.\nNote that an additive game is always superadditive, constant-sum,\nweakly constant-sum and degenerate whereas none of these four\ngame properties guarantee additivity in return.\nThis game property can be checked via the \nfunction **isAdditiveGame**.\n\n### Weakly superadditive games\n\nWe call a TU game $v$ with $n$ players **weakly superadditive** if \n\n$$ v(S \\cup \\{ i \\}) \\geq v(S) + v(\\{ i \\}) $$\nfor all coalitions $S \\subseteq N$ and\nall players $i=1, \\dots ,n$ with $i \\notin S$,\nsee e.g. [@PelegSudhoelter], p. 10. Note that\nweak superadditivity is equivalent to 0-monotonicity, i.e. the\nzero-normalization of the game is monotonic, see\ne.g. [@MaschlerSolanZamir], p. 789, or [@PelegSudhoelter], p. 12.\nThis game property can be checked via the \nfunction **isWeaklySuperadditiveGame**.\n\n### Quasi-balanced games\nGiven a TU game $v$ with $n$ players let $m$ denote\nthe minimal rights vector and $M$ the utopia payoff vector.\nWe call the TU game $v$ **quasi-balanced** if\n$m(i) \\leq M(i)$ for all $i=1, \\dots, n$ and \n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_{i} \\leq v(N) \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^{n} M_{i}, $$\nsee e.g. [@BranzeiBook], p. 31.\nQuasi-balanced games can equivalently be characterized\nas the TU games with a non-empty core cover.\nNote also the $\\tau$-value, an important solution\nconcept, is only defined for quasi-balanced games,\nsee e.g. the original paper by Tijs [@Tijs1981].\nThis game property can be checked via the \nfunction **isQuasiBalancedGame**.\n\n### Balanced games\nA TU game $v$ is called **balanced** if and only if the core\nof $v$ is non-empty. For the sake of brevity we\ndo not go into any details of the balancedness condition\nand the Bondareva-Shapley theorem in this vignette.\nInstead, we only refer to the original papers by \nBondareva [@bondareva1963some] and by Shapley\n[@shapley1967balanced] as well as to section 3.1 of\nthe book by Peleg and Sudhölter [@PelegSudhoelter] for\nfurther details.\nThis game property can be checked via the \nfunction **isBalancedGame**.\n\n### Convex games \nWe call a TU game $v$ **convex** if \n\n$$ v(S \\cup T) + v(S \\cap T) \\geq v(S) + v(T) $$\nfor all $S, T \\subseteq N$, see e.g.\n[@PelegSudhoelter], p. 10, for more details. Convex\ngames are always\nbalanced, i.e. the core of a convex game is never empty, and\nthey arise in various important application areas of\ncooperative game theory.\nThis game property can be checked via the \nfunction **isConvexGame**.\n\n### Semiconvex games\nA TU game $v$ with $n$ players is called **semiconvex**\nif for its gap function $g$ there holds\n$$0 \\leq g(i) \\leq g(S)$$\nfor all players $i=1, \\dots, n$ and\nall coalitions $S \\subseteq N$ with $i \\in S$.\nNote that convex games are always semiconvex but not\nvice versa.\nWe refer to the book by Driessen [@DriessenBook], p. 76, or\nthe original paper by Driessen and Tijs [@driessen1985tau] for\nmore details.\nThis game property can be checked via the \nfunction **isSemiConvexGame**.\n\n### 1-convex games\n\nA TU game $v$ with $n$ players is called **1-convex**\nif for its gap function $g$ there holds\n$$0 \\leq g(N) \\leq g(S)$$\nfor all coalitions $S \\subseteq N$ with $S \\neq \\emptyset$.\nNote that the 1-cover of a 1-convex game will always be convex.\nWe refer to the book by Driessen [@DriessenBook], p. 73, for\nmore details.\nThis game property can be checked via the \nfunction **is1ConvexGame**.\n\n",
