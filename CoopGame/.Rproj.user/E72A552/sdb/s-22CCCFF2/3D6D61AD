Due to the modular structure and high granularity, this was largely possible with minor adaptation.\nIn addition, the respective implementation of the nucleolus and its variants will be discussed, with particular attention being paid to the realization of the nucleolus; it serves as the basis of all other derivatives.\n\n\n![Class Diagramme of the Nucleolus Derivates](media/class_diagramme_nucleolus_derivates.PNG)",
