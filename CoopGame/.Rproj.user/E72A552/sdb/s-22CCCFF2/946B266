In addition, the number of constraints considered increases by a multiple. The entire coefficient matrix and the corresponding right column of the initial linear program must be adapted. For this the two methods **initLPMatrix** and **initLPRows** are overwritten by the class **Modiclus**.\nThe initialization of the right side of the linear program is accomplished by overriding the **initLPRows** method.",
