By contrast, the restrictions remain unrestricted upwards, except for the entry of the grand coalition. For this, the corresponding coalition value is also set here as the upper limit. For the border types, all restrictions with '**GLP_LO**' are specified to be restricted down to the restriction for the grand coalition. In the large coalition restriction, '**GLP_FX**' sets an equality constraint on the border type.\n\nThe method **initLPBndsObjCoefs** is defined for the nucleolus so that for the lower bounds of the decision variables the values of the one-coalitions v ({i}) are defined. For the upper bound, it is determined that these are also unlimited in the positive. An exception is the decision variable to be minimized for the surplus; it is a free variable that is completely unlimited.\nIn the objective function, only the decision variable for the excess should be minimized.\n\n",
