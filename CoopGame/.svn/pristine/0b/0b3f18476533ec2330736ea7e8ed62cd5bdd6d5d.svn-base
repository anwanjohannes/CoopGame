## The Class CoopGameCFunc
The game vector represents the cooperative game and either can be created by the user
definining each coalition value himself or using one of the provided coalition function classes
which is derived from the virtual class `CoopGameCFunc`.
The class `CoopGameCFunc` posseses two slots to keep the game vector and the number of players - these are the essential information and is in common with all coalition functions.
The method initialize uses its `getCoalitionValue` method for initialization of an object derived from `CoopGameCFunc`.
Hereby the `getCoalitionValue` method determines for every possible coalition the corresponding coalition value.
For a new coalition function class it is therefore sufficient to define a new class which heritates from `CoopGameCFunc` and extend the slots regarding the additional information needed for identifying all possible coalition values.
All coalition functions in the package CoopGame provide the user wrapper functions for creating an S4 object of the coalition function (same naming as class), retrieving the corresponding game vector to a coalition function (naming `<classname>Vector`) as well as for the value of a single coalition (naming `<classname>Value`).
For a better understanding of the coalition function concept (naming with prefix `cFunc`) examplary `cFuncGlove`, which implements the glove game, is reviewed in the following section.
