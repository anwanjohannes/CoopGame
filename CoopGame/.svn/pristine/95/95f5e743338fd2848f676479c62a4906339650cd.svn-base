# The Internal Structure of CoopGame and its S4-classes
The package CoopGame comprises both object-orientated as well as procedural programming concepts.
On the one hand, the procedural exported functions serve first of all as interface to the simple user; without the user even knowing of S4 classes and object orientation, he simply can use functionalities of CoopGame. Therefore the provided functions are meant as wrappers for hidding S4 classes and its methods calls. 
But on the other hand, object-orientation is used for structuring and supplying a higher degree of modularization of the individual concepts, especially of the nucleolus and its derivatives.
R has several object-oriented approaches for instance with the S3 and S4 Classes or the Reference Classes R6 but for CoopGame the S4 system was chosen based on its formal definition of representation and inheritance as well as the possibility for methods with muliple dispatch.
