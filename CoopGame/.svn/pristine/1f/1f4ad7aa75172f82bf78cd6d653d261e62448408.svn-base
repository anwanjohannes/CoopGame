#### The Design of the Class NucleolusBase

The virtual class NucleolusBase contains as class attributes the game vector A and an object of the class LPCoopGameUtils.
In addition, the class defines with initLPBndsObjCoefs, initLPMatrix, initLPRows as well as determineExcessCoefficients methods to intervene in the initialization and updateLPBndsObjCoefs, updateLPMatrix, updateLPRows getLPDualSolutionPos and getLPRowsBoundsFunc in the update of the linear program.
The checkAbort method, on the other hand, controls the circumstances under which the responsible method calculateNucleolus should be aborted prematurely during the calculation if either the calculation is complete or no solution is available.
All derivatives later inherit from the class NucleolusBase and, if there are differences, the responsible method is simply overwritten.
Furthermore, the solution procedure with the object initialization in the initialize and the logic within the method calculateNucleolus will be given special attention because here all important prerequisites are created and later the essential steps for the calculation of the nucleolus or its derivative are executed.
