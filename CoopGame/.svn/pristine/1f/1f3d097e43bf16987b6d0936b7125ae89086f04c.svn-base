### Example of the Shapley Value
For the shapley value example, a voting game with four players and their weights w = (35,21,15,15) and the quota of q = 51 to be fulfilled serves.
This results in the coalition values described below.

Values of single player's coalitions:
$v\left(1\right)=v\left(2\right)=v\left(3\right)=v\left(4\right)=0$
Values of two players' coalitions:
$v\left(1,2\right)=1;v\left(1,3\right)=v\left(1,4\right)=0;\left(2,3\right)=v\left(2,4\right)=0;v\left(3,4\right)=0$
Values of three players' coalitions:
$v\left(1,2,3\right)=v\left(1,2,4\right)=v\left(1,3,4\right)=1;v\left(2,3,4\right)=1$
Wert der Gro√üen Koalition:
$v\left(1,2,3,4\right)=1$

Since a voting game is a simple game in which the marginal contribution $MB_i$ of a player i is either numbered 1 or 0, it is sufficient to determine the Shapley point in this simple example. How many times player i appears as a pivot player. A pivot player is a critical player who, by joining a coalition K, decides whether a loss (v (K) = 0) becomes a winning coalition (v (K) = 1).
The Shapley Value results in a simple game for a player by dividing the number of his pivots by the total number of permutations.

For the given example and with the number of player pivots of (8,8,4,4), the Shapley Values is  $\phi_1=\phi_2=\frac{1}{3}$ and $\phi_3=\phi_4=\frac{1}{6}$.
