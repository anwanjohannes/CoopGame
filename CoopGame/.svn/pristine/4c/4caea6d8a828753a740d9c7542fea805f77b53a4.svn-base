## Public Good Value
The Public Good Value (PGV) is a proprietary solution concept defined by the Public Good Index (PGI).
The PGI is a power index that gives each player a value between 0 and 1, with the sum of the power indices of all players at 1.
The PGI concept is based on collective acceptance (Holler & Illing 2006: 325). The individual preferences of the respective players are thereby neglected, since the focus is solely on the determination of the respective scope of power of the player and not the fulfillment of his interests.
Holler & Illing (2006: 325) describe a collective good as a good that fully and completely benefits all players in a coalition. Here the usual distribution problem is completely eliminated. As examples, votes in parliaments and committees can be used.
As a consequence of collective acceptance (Holler & Illing 2006: 325), the CIP refers exclu-sively to minimum profit coalitions M (v). It will be briefly specified below.
