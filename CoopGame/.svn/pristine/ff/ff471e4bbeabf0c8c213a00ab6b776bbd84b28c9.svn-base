#### The Implementation of the Modiclus {#TIOTMOD}
The differences between the implementation of the Modiclus and that of the nucleolus prove to be very extensive.
In contrast to the nucleolus, the modiclus minimizes lexicographically not the maximum value for the excess but its differences; a mere overriding of the determineExcessCoefficients is no longer sufficient. In addition, the number of constraints considered increases by a multiple. The entire coefficient matrix and the corresponding right column of the initial linear program must be adapted. For this the two methods initLP-Matrix and initLPRows are overwritten by the class Modiclus.
The initialization of the right side of the linear program is accomplished by overriding the initLPRows method.
