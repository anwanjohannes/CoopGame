#### The Design of the Class NucleolusBase

The virtual class `NucleolusBase` contains as class attributes the game vector `A` and an object of the class `LPCoopGameUtils`.
In addition, the class defines with `initLPBndsObjCoefs`, `initLPMatrix`, `initLPRows` as well as `determineExcessCoefficients` methods to intervene in the initialization and `updateLPBndsObjCoefs`, `updateLPMatrix`, `updateLPRows`, `getLPDualSolutionPos` and `getLPRowsBoundsFunc` in the update of the linear program.
The `checkAbort` method, on the other hand, controls the circumstances under which the responsible method `calculateNucleolus` should be aborted prematurely during the calculation if either the calculation is complete or no solution is available.
All derivatives later inherit from the class `NucleolusBase` and, if there are differences, the responsible method is simply overwritten.
Furthermore, the solution procedure with the object initialization in the initialize and the logic within the method `calculateNucleolus` will be given special attention because here all important prerequisites are created and later the essential steps for the calculation of the nucleolus or its derivative are executed.
