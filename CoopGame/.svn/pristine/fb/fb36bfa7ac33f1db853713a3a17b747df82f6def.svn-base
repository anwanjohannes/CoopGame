### The Implementation of the Nucleolus and its Derivates {#H_TIOTNAID}

Using the framework the nucleolus and the prenucleolus are implemented as well as other derivatives such as the per capita nucleolus, the proportional nucleolus, the disruption nucleolus, the modiclus and one of its variants of the simplified modiclus. Due to the modular structure and high granularity, this was largely possible with minor adaptation.
In addition, the respective implementation of the nucleolus and its variants will be discussed, with particular attention being paid to the realization of the nucleolus; it serves as the basis of all other derivatives.
