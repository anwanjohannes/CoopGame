### The Class GameProperty
Classes in CoopGame implementing game properties are derived from GameProperty and have the prefix GameProperty in their class-name. 
One example for one implemented game property in CoopGame is GamePropertyEssentiality which checks if a game is essential. Therefore 
GamePropertyEssentiality implements the method determineProperty.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setMethod(
  "determineProperty",
  signature="GamePropertyEssentiality",
  definition=function(.Object){
    A<-.Object@A
    result=logicIsEssentialGame(A)
    return(result)
  }
)
```
In the function providing the logic for this game property check it is proved if the sum reached by all single coalitions exceeds the value of the grand coalition.
In case the value of the grand coalition is surpassed the game is not essential otherwise it is.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
logicIsEssentialGame <- function(A) {
  numberOfPlayers <- getNumberOfPlayers(A)
  isEssential <- FALSE
  scVal <- sum(A[1:numberOfPlayers])
  gcVal <- A[length(A)]

  if (gcVal >= scVal) {
    isEssential <- TRUE
  } else {
    isEssential <- FALSE
  }

  return(isEssential)
}
```
