### The Definition of the Public Good Index
Before redistributing the value of the CIP, this section explains how it is composed.
Because the PGI is based on the minimum profit coalitions and profit coalitions, these are indispensable for the PGI concept and are briefly characterized.
According to WIESE (2005: 91), winning coalitions are all coalitions K that have a coalition value of 1 for a simple game (eg a voting game), for coalitions K with v \ left (K \ right) = 0 corresponding to loss coalitions , As a generalized modification of the definition of a win coalition v for simple games according to WIESE (2005: 91), the amount of all winning coalitions - based on all games (N, v) - can be defined as in formula 32.

$W\left(v\right)=\left\{K\ \subseteq N\ \right|v\left(K\right)>0\}$

The expression W_i \ left (v \ right) here describes the subset of the winning coalitions in which the player i \ in \ N participates.

$W_i\left(v\right)=\{K\ \subseteq N\ \left|v\left(K\right)>0\ \land i\ \in K\right\}$

Minimum Profit Coalitions are coalitions composed solely of critical players. If only a single player falls away, the profit coalition turns into a losing coalition, where no common value is earned. Minimum profit coalitions can be defined as in Formula 34 (Holler & Illing 2006: 323).

$M\left(v\right)=\left\{K\ \subseteq\ N\ \right|v\left(K\right)>0\ and\ v\left(L\right)=0,\ \forall\ L\subset\ K\}$

The sum of all coalition values v (K) for all K \ in \ M (v) \ and the player \ i \ \ in \ K will be listed as c_i (v) in Formula 35 below.

$c_i(v)=\sum_{i\in\ K;K\inM(v)}\{v(K)\}$

From the collective acceptance and the limitation to minimum profit coagulations, the PGI is therefore derived according to formula 34 and formula 35 as defined in formula 36 (Holler & Illing 2006: 325f).

$\{PGI\}_i(v)=\frac\{c_i(v)\}\{\sum_\{j\in N\}\{c_j(v)\}\} und \sum_\{j\in N\}\{\{PGI\}_i(v)\}=1$
