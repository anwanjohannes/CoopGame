#### The Implementation of the Per Capita Nucleolus {#H_TIOTPERCAPNUC}
The Per Capita Nucleolus normalizes the nucleolus by dividing the surplus by the number of players involved in each Coalition.
Here it is sufficient to override determineExcessCoefficients for the class PerCapitaNucleolus, so that the column values of the structure variable to be minimized are given the correspond-ing number of players involved in the respective coalition as coefficients.
Otherwise, no changes are to be made here.
