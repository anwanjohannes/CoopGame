# Point Solution Concepts

For coalition games, numerous solution concepts can be cited, whereby in principle a distinction can be made between point and value approaches.
If quantity approaches are used to reduce the payout amount to a subset with certain characteristics, valuations aim to derive a clear solution.
Sets of measures give the players rational decision-making frames with a more or less large degree of indeterminacy, whereas valuations provide the players with clear action directives.
As part of this work, no new quantity approaches have been developed to the already existing - such as the core and the Weber and Imputationsmenge - as the focus was placed specifically on the extension of the package CoopGame to new valuations.
With the Banzhaf, Deegan Packel, Gately, Johnston, Public Good, Public Help, Shapley and tau value, the package contains many simple point-value concepts.
Furthermore, the package contains more complex concepts such as the nucleolus and related approaches such as the disruption nucleolus, modiclus, per capita nucleolus, prenucleolus, proportional nucleolus and simplified modiclus.
