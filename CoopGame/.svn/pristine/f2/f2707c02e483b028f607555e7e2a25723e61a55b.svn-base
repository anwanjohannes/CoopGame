#### The Implementation of the Prenucleolus {#H_TIOTPRENUC}

Unlike the nucleolus, the prenucleolus takes into account not the imputation but the pre-imputation amount as a permissible disbursement space. This is the only difference between the two concepts.
Therefore, only the initLPBndsObjCoefs method had to be over-written to set the decision value bounds according to the pre-imputation set as payoff space.
If the restrictions in the Nucleolus implementation were still limited by the demanded property of the individual rationality for imputations, the demand falls away with the larger scope for the preimputation set.
