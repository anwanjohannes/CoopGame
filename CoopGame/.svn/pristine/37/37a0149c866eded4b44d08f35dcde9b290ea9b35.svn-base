## Shapley Value
The Shapley value is a very widespread solution concept in cooperative game theory.
It was introduced by SHAPLEY (1953) and has since been used increasingly in the field. 
According to HOLLER & ILLING (2006: 305f), the measure essentially does not look at coalitions as such, but at the various permutations of the players, which reflect the entry of players in certain decision-making situations. In these specific situations, the influence of the player on the game is examined. With regard to all players and decision situations, taking into account the different levels of influence of the players results in the Shapley value according to the definition presented below.
