### Definition of the Shapley Value
The shapley value of a player $i \in N$ and the game v is defined as in formula 30 (HOLLER & ILLING 2006: 304).

$\phi_i\left(v\right)=\sum_{K\ni i;K\subset N}\frac{\left(k-1\right)!\left(n-k\right)!}{n!}\left[v\left(K\right)-v(K-{i})\right], with\ \sum{\phi_i\left(v\right)=v(N)}$

In this case, $k$ expresses the number of players $k = card (K)$ participating in Coalition $K$ and n the total number of involved players $n = card(N)$.
The expression $\left [v \left (K \right) -v (K- {i}) \right] with i \\in K$ describes the player's marginal contribution to the coalition k.
How many times the coalition K within the n! Permutations occurs, the term $\frac{\left(k-1\right)!\left(n-k\right)!}{n!}$ describes.
