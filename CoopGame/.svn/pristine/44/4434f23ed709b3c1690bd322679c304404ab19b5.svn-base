## The Nucleolus S4 Framework

The following section presents the concept of the framework for the calculation of various nucleolus derivatives based on an object-oriented approach in R with S4 classes. In designing a framework for the calculation of the nucleolus and its derivatives, other key considerations besides a desired clean separation of responsibilities came into play.
On the one hand, it was important to be able to react as flexibly as possible to the differences between the various derivatives; on the other hand, redundant code should be avoided as much as possible.
Therefore it is able to deal with possible differences between the various variants in the individual calculation steps and helps to avoid redundant code.
For a first separation of responsibilities, two classes were implemented: the class `LPCoopGameUtils` and `NucleolusBase`.
The intention of the `LPCoopGameUtils` class was to delineate tasks and data held in the context of the Linear Program from the logic for calculating the nucleolus or one of its derivatives. However, the class `NucleolusBase` has the responsibility for the implementation of the calculation algorithm.

The two classes will be discussed in the following sections. However, a brief introduction to the GLPK Library used for the linear program solution is given in advance.
