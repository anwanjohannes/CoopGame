# Cooperative Games with Special Structure

The field of cooperative game theory is exciting.


The concept of evolutionary stable strategies (ESS) was first 
proposed by Maynard Smith and Price in. An incumbent 
strategy $x$ is said to be evolutionary stable if 

- it is either a unique best reply to itself or   
- in case there exists an alternative best reply $y$ to $x$,
then $x$ is a better reply to this mutant strategy $y$ than 
$y$ is to itself.  

If $x$ is a strict Nash equilibrium, then $x$ must also be an ESS.  
Using our package EvolutionaryGames one can compute ESS 
for both $2$ x $2$ and $3$ x $3$ symmetric matrix games.
The function **ESS.R** receives three input arguments:

- `A` : A matrix specifying the symmetric game
- `strategies`: A vector of strings of length $2$ or $3$ 
specifying the names of all strategies
- `floats`: A logical value that handles number representation. If floats 
is set to `TRUE` (default), a floating-point number will be used for the 
output, otherwise the output will be 
specified as fractions.

Let us first take a look at a classical Hawk-Dove game.

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
library(CoopGame)
```

It is well known that there are games which do not possess 
an ESS. A classical example is the game Rock-Scissors-Paper.
In such a case our function **ESS.R** will return NULL.
