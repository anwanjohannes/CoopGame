## The Class CoopGameProperty
Basically in the package CoopGame it is distinguished between allocation and game properties. 
Out of this reason three virtual classes are designed in CoopGame:
`AllocationProperty` for allocation properties, `GameProperty` for game properties and finally `CoopGameProperty` (itself sibling of CoopGameBase) where the previous classes are derived from.
All property classes implement the method `determineProperty` which returns either TRUE in case the investigated property is satisfied or FALSE when it is not.
The class `AllocationProperty` and `GameProperty` are discussed next.
