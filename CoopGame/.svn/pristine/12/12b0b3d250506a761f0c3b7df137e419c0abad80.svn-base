### The exemplary Usage of cFuncGlove
The user can easily create one object of `cFuncGlove` by using the wrapper function which is named same as the class `cFuncGlove`.
```{r, echo = TRUE}
cFuncGlove(n=3,L=c(1,2),R=3)
```
For retrieving the game vector object also one wrapper function is provided to the user as well as for the coalition value of one certain coalition.
```{r, echo = TRUE}
cFuncGloveVector(n=3,L=c(1,2),R=3)
```
Below we show one example where the coalition S of player 1 and 2 can not generate one match as they both only have left gloves.
```{r, echo = TRUE}
cFuncGloveValue(S=c(1,2),L=c(1,2),R=3)
```
Instead of the previous example here player 1 and 2 together retrieve one pair of gloves because player 1 keeps one left and player 2 one right glove. 
```{r, echo = TRUE}
cFuncGloveValue(S=c(1,2),L=c(1,3),R=2)
```
