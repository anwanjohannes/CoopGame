# Set Solution Concepts

The field of cooperative game theory is exciting.

## The various evolutionary dynamics available in EvolutionaryGames

The basic game-theoretic model of biological natural selection is 
the replicator dynamic [@geometry]. Still, various alternative 
dynamics have been proposed and investigated for different applications. 
Our package currently focusses on continuous dynamics only. 
The following itemization states which evolutionary dynamics are 
currently available in our package EvolutionaryGames:

- **Replicator.R** : The standard replicator dynamic
- **BNN.R** : The Brown-von Neumann-Nash dynamic 
- **BR.R** : The Best Reponse dynamic by Gilboa and Matsui 
- **ILogit.R** : The imitative Logit dynamic by Weibull 
It requires the parameter `eta`. 
- **Logit.R** : The Logit dynamic by Fudenberg and Levine. It 
requires the parameter `eta`.
- **MSReplicator.R** : The Maynard-Smith dynamic 
- **Smith.R** : The Smith dynamic 

## Drawing phase diagrams for two, three and four strategies

### Two Strategies
Drawing phase diagrams for single-population games 
with two, three or 
four phenotypes with different dynamics is the main feature of 
the package EvolutionaryGames.
We start with a rather simple Hawk-Dove game we studied before
when analyzing for its ESS. Using **phaseDiagram2S.R** we 
obtain a phase diagram for the 
population share of hawks invading a population of doves under 
the replicator dynamics.

For similar phase diagrams, see e.g. the book by Peters [@PetersBook].  

### Three Strategies
In the phase diagrams for the three strategies the user 
may specify the following parameters for **phaseDiagram3S.R**:

- `A`: A Numeric matrix of size $3$ x $3$ representing the number of 
strategies of a symmetric matrix game.    
- `dynamic`: A function representing an evolutionary dynamic.  
- `params`: A numeric vector with additional parameters for the 
evolutionary dynamic, like e.g. in the cases of the Logit or ILogit 
dynamics.  
- `trajectories`: A numeric matrix of size $m$ x $3$. Each row represents 
the initial values for the trajectory to be examined.  
- `contour`: A logical value that handles contour diagram presentation. 
By default `FALSE`, a nicely coloured contour plot will only be 
shown if the user sets `contour = TRUE`.  
- `vectorField`: A logical value that handles vector field presentation. 
By default `FALSE`, a vector field will only be 
shown if the user sets `vectorField = TRUE`. 
- `strategies`: A vector of strings of length $3$ 
specifying the names of all strategies. By default 
`strategies = c("1","2","3")`.
