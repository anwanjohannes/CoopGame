#### The Implementation of the Lexical Gately Point
Like the Disruption Nucleolus, the Lexical Gately point also lexicographically minimizes the maximum propensities to disruption, but ignoring all coalitions. For this reason, the parent class LexicalGatelyValue is also named DisruptionNucleolus.
The Lexical Gately point is limited as a unique variant of the Gately point only on the one-coalitions, so only the method determineExcessCoefficients must be overwritten.
