# Game Properties

The field of cooperative game theory is exciting.

The concept of evolutionarily stable sets 
was first discussed by B. Thomas in. 
A very readable introduction can also be found in the book 
by Weibull [@PetersBook], section 2.4.1.  
An evolutionarily stable set is a nonempty closed set 
of symmetric Nash equilibrium strategies $X$ such that 
each strategy $x \in X$ earns at least the same payoff 
against any nearby alternative best reply $y$ as 
$y$ earns against itself with equal payoffs limited 
to the case $y \in X$. Note that any evolutionary stable 
strategy (ESS) constitutes an evolutionarily stable set and 
that the union of evolutionarily stable sets is again an 
evolutionarily stable set. See the book by Weibull [@PetersBook], 
section 2.4.1, for further details.  
Evolutionarily stable sets are not easy to compute and to plot.
The package EvolutionaryGames computes evolutionarily stable sets of a 
game with two players and three strategies in the case that the game has 
an evolutionary stable strategy (ESS). If the two player three strategy 
game has no ESS, then the code returns a message stating that 
our algorithm cannot calculate evolutionarily stable sets for models 
that do not have a proper ESS. The authors are very well aware 
that there are games having evolutionarily stable sets but no proper ESS.
Still, as our package is not devoted to finding all symmetric 
Nash equilibria of a game and as there currently is no package 
for this task on CRAN, we decided only to handle the case of 
games with two players and three strategies possessing at least one 
proper ESS. Within our algorithm, we need a proper ESS as a 
starting point for our computations. The authors feel that the 
possibility of computing and drawing evolutionarily stable sets in 
such cases is precious for teaching (and research) purposes. However, 
note that computing and drawing evolutionarily stable sets is 
time consuming and is clearly the most elaborate task currently 
performed by the package EvolutionaryGames. Finally, here is an 
example of an evolutionarily stable set 
together with a plot 
including sample trajectories (-- the example itself is 
taken from the book [@PetersBook], p. 52):

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
library(CoopGame)
A <- matrix(c(-2, 5, 10/9, 0, 5/2, 10/9, -10/9, 35/9, 10/9), 3, byrow=TRUE)
strategies <- c("Hawk", "Dove", "Mixed ESS")
```
$n\ast\ v\left(N\right)=\sum_{S:\ \left|S\right|=1}\ v\left(N-S\right)+\sum_{S:\ \left|S\right|=1}\ v\left(S\right)$
