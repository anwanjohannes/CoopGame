# CoopGame
Important Concepts of Cooperative Game Theory, the earlier version.

This github repository contains the initially intended release version (0.1.0) of the R package CoopGame, which laterly was modified and published as version 0.2.1 on 2019-03-19 on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CoopGame/index.html).
Besides find attached my master thesis "Untersuchungen zur kooperativen Spieltheorie und Erweiterung des R-Pakets CoopGame" composed in German language and reached in 2017-07-17 at Hochschule Kempten, predominantly putting focus on the implementation of an framework for solving nucleolus derivatives.
This framework followed an objective oriented approach by the usage of the S4 class system in R but also benefitted by the bachelor thesis of Daniel Gebele (2016) "Nucleolus und Pränucleolus als Lösungskonzepte fur Kooperationsspiele und Untersuchungen in R" at Hochschule Kempten.

## Updates
* 2019-04-04, added R package AuxiliaryTools: Package helps as described in its documentation and in the already mentioned master thesis to maintain error codes and messages in the package CoopGame centrally
